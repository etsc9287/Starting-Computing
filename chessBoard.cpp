//Algorithm: Figures out if inputted square on a chessboard is a light or dark square
    //1. take a character and and an integer as parameters
    //2. check if the two inputs combine to equal a light square or dark square
    //3. Print the appropriate description of the square based on its color (white or black)
//Input parameters: a-h (chars) and 1-8 (ints)
//Output: prints black or white (strings)
//Returns: none
