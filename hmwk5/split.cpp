//Algorithm: Figures out number of words in a sentence
    //1. take any string and a delimiter as parameters
    //2. Create loop that counts each character that isn't delimiter, prints it
    //3. Create loop that counts each character that is delimiter, print new paragraph each time
    //4. # of lines = delimiters (not inclduing consecutive ones) + 1, return count + 1
    //5. Create loop that detects if theres consecutive delimiters, don't create new paragraph here
//Input parameters: any string, delimiter
//Output: all phrases between delimiters in different lines
//Returns: number of words in sentence
