// Project 1 - Problem 3 

//Algorithm: Play jeopardy dice with computer until a player reaches 80 points. 
    //1. Create 3 of my own functions - representing computer's turn, human's turn, and additional messages
    //2. start easy - take care of welcome statements and other easy print statements first
    //3. move to human turn function which will return their total points for that turn - create user input for whether or not they would like to roll
    //4. create general if/else statements depending on original user input (y,n).  If n, end turn and player total is 0.
    //5. create conditionals for all the dice rolls.  If they end the turn, insert breaks in the if/else statements, create accumulator pattern for 1,3,6 as they can get added
    //6. create a while loop outside of these conditionals so the user can possibly continue rolling dice throughout their turn as long as they say yes, gives breaks a purpose
    //7. move to computer function which will return its total points for that turn - no user input needed
    //8. recycle the conditionals for dice rolls in human function and the accumulator pattern if 1,3,6 - same rules apply to computer
    //9. create a while loop outside of these conditionals so that the computer continues until it possibly hits 10 points
    //10. At this point, I should have a welcome message and two useful functions that return points totals for individual turns
    //11. In my game function, create variables that call my own 3 previous functions
    //12. Create a while loop that continously switches between computer turn and human turn as long as neither has reached 80 points
    //13. Create an accumulator pattern that utilizes returns from previous two functions, adds points for each turn for both players
    //14. Create conditionals that print winning messages if one player hits 80 points.
    //15. Remember seed randoms to create complete randomness
//Input parameters: see individual functions
//Output: a game that accepts y/n until the player or computer reaches 80 points.
//Returns: see individual functions

//1. start easy - take care of welcome statements and other easy print statements first

//3. create conditionals for all the dice rolls.  If they end the turn, insert breaks in the if/else statements, create accumulator pattern for 1,3,6 as they can get added
