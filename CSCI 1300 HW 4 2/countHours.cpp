//Algorithm: Figures out hours in a month depending on the month
    //1. take an integer as a paramter from 1 to 12
    //2. For each month, check the amount of hours in that month.
    //3. Print the appropriate amount of hours based on the month checks.
//Input parameters: integer from 1 to 12 (int)
//Output: hours in that month (int)
//Returns: hours in that month (int)
