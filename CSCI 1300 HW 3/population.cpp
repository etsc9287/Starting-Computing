//Algorithm: Find population in a year given initial population, births, deaths, and immigrants
    //1. take initial population as a parameter
    //2. take second increments of births, deaths, and immigrants as variables
    //3. divide seconds in a year by these increments to get births, deaths, and immigrants per year
    //4. add births and immigrants to our initial population and subtract deaths to get out population in a year.
    //5. return this variable and then print the population in a year
//Input parameters: initial population (int)
//Output: prints final population (int)
//Returns: final population (int)
